        ## Installation
        1. install via pip: `pip install anki-kunren`
        2. install [anki-connect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) with code `2055492159`
        
        
        ## Usage
        **Open Anki and begin a review. You can then use `kunren` as follows:**
        
        usage: `kunren [-h] [-s S] [-d D] [--field FIELD] [--size SIZE]`
        
        optional arguments:
        + `-h, --help` Show help message
        + `-s S` Start point size in px. defaults to 5px
        + `-d D` Stroke forgiveness in average px from actual. defaults to 25px
        + `--field FIELD` name of anki card field containing kanji. defaults to "Vocabulary-Kanji"
        + `--size SIZE` Length of a size of the square canvas in pixels. Defaults to 300.
        
        While running, you can use the following controls:
        + `h`: hint the current stroke
        + `a`: animate the current stroke
        + `n`: next kanji in the expression
        + `esc`: quit
        + `c`: refresh the current card shown. This is done automatically when all characters have been drawn, but would slow the program to a crawl if checked for every frame.
        
        ### Notes
        + When the size parameter is changed, all tolerances get multiplied by the ratio of `size/109`.
        
        ## Other

        The KanjiVG ascii filename code is taken from [Kanji Colorizer](https://github.com/cayennes/kanji-colorize) which was also the source of my initial inspiration.
        
        ## TODO
        + catch all indexoutofbounds
        + smoother kanji lines
        + different coloring for different parts of stroke based on how wrong it is.
